### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- When I first tried to create the pod file in the flixster folder, I received an error message saying that I do not have the permission to change the file. I googled the error and tried solving it, but only one suggestion out of 10 worked. Eventually, I went to the settings on my computer and gave terminal access to all files and directories. This solved the problem.
